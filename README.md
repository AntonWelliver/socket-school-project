# Chat App Socket School Project

#### Socket chat with Web API integration

A chat-based app that lets users chat with each other in real time. The communication is set up and done with socket.io. In addition to the chat part of the task, it's also possible to write commands. This is done by starting to type "/" and then giving the user suggestions for valid commands.

- A working chat where you can type a command "/" to perform operations which integrates with third party systems.
- You can choose a nickname
- It's visible to others when someone writes
- It's possible to join password protected rooms
