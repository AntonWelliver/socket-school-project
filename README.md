# Chat App Socket School Project

#### Socket chat with Web API integration

You will create a chat-based app that lets users chat with each other in real time. The communication should be set up and done with socket.io. In addition to the chat part of the task, it should also be possible to write commands. This is done by starting to type "/" and then giving the user suggestions for valid commands - like how it works in Slack, for example.
